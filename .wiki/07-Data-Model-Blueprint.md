## Family and User Concepts

`families` is the tenant root. All product data includes `family_id` unless explicitly global system metadata.

`users` includes role, lifecycle state, and profile fields needed by policy engines.

`relationships` supports family-graph features and optional cultural policy logic.

## Content Surfaces

### Family content

- journals, posts, albums, documents
- visibility policy references
- optional guardianship or inheritance tags

### TV content

- VOD items, episodes, sports recordings
- manifest pointers, runtime metadata, transcoding status
- optional ad-marker metadata and trickplay assets

### Podcast content

- podcast shows with RSS feed URLs and refresh schedules
- podcast episodes with audio URLs, duration, chapter data
- per-user subscriptions and episode progress tracking

### Game content

- game platforms (NES, SNES, PS1, etc.) with emulator tier classification
- game titles with metadata (year, genre, cover art, content rating)
- ROM file references in object storage (server operator managed)
- per-user save states with cloud sync and conflict resolution

### Tenant configuration

- white-label branding (name, logos, colors, fonts)
- feature toggles (which content verticals are enabled)
- API endpoint overrides and update channel settings

## Live and Device Model

- AntBox and AntServer represented as trusted devices/services.
- Device registration and heartbeat states tracked.
- Live events map schedule -> ingest -> archive lifecycle.

## Schema Evolution Rules

1. All migrations are forward-only and reversible where practical.
2. Destructive migrations require explicit data retention strategy.
3. Every migration must include compatibility notes for clients.
